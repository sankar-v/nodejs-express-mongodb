"# nodejs-express-mongodb" 
One of the advantages of a typical disconnected application is the ability to eveolve the client and server components indepdnetly and also the abilit to mix and match the client and server components to get the maximium out of the available stacks and is an adoption of an existing site for inspiration. 

This project focused more on using the mongodb as the no relation datastore and using mongoose ODB to connect to it and to host the rest APIs for the front end clients.  The focus was on the backend. But slowly evolved into a graphql initiative with graphql api layer on top rather than use express for REST APIs.

One could easily check the working using the graphiQL playground for testing the queries and mutations.  A drop in front end react/or any javascript UI replacement is is a perfect combination.  Once  the front end is developed, it will be made available as the drop in replacement. 

Happy programming!!
